# Dog Behaviour Specialists – SQL Queries 🐾

This repository contains a collection of SQL queries written as part of my INFO90002 assignment at the University of Melbourne.  
The queries demonstrate skills in **joins, subqueries, grouping, aggregation, filtering, and view creation**.

## 📌 Project Overview
The database models a medium‑sized business providing dog training services across multiple venues.  
The queries answer real‑world business questions such as:
- Events by suburb
- Services never requested at a venue
- Event popularity by attendance
- Trainer workload analysis
- Venue revenue reports
- Owner and dog participation in lessons/events
- Multi‑year event tracking
- Creating and querying SQL views

## 🛠 Skills Demonstrated
- SQL joins (INNER, LEFT OUTER)
- Subqueries with `NOT IN`
- Aggregations with `COUNT`, `SUM`, `HAVING`
- Date filtering with `YEAR()` and ranges
- Creating and querying **views**
- Writing recruiter‑ready, well‑structured SQL
